In this project, I've recreated the well known strategy game called Risk.
Unfortunately, there's no computer AI yet.

When I first met RaphaelJS, I was amazed by its ability to dynamically modify
SVG. A small online RaphaelJS demo motivated me to write this game, which is
mainly inspired by the good old computer game Risk II. It's code is large and
complex so at some point developing it further became too hard. There is no
computer AI or online multiplayer yet and the game won't recognize if you've
conquered the world. However, the music, composed by my nephew, is beautiful!
I learned a lot about RaphaelJS, CSS3 and JavaScript by developing this game.

You can check out the game [here](https://bergwerf.github.io/risk/).
