Logic Board is an Android app to simulate simple logic circuits.

I had to make some logic circuits for physics at school. To learn wiring
electrical logic, we have something we call a 'system board' at school. These
boards contain a number of logic gates, a pulse generator, some LED's, a counter
and some other components. You can connect these components with wires. This
way, you can create simple logic systems. While working with these boards, I
discovered it's real fun to mess around with logic circuits. This inspired me to
make an Android app that enables you to simulate some simple electrical
circuits. To make it a little more exiting, I integrated some hardware including
the flashlight, the volume +/- button, the return button, and also some sensors
including the proximity sensor, the light sensor and the microphone. If you have
an Android device and you know a thing or two about electrical logic; install
Logic Board, it's fun and it's totally free!

You can download the app on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hermanbergwerf.logicboard).
