Cruzzle combines a sliding puzzle and Rubiks cube into a new kind of puzzle.

I spent hours trying to solve a Rubiks cube. The Rubiks cube is simple to
understand but hard to solve, and I like that concept. I always wanted to have a
Rubics cube on my tablet or smartphone but a Rubiks cube is 3D and a tablet is
flat. In order to make it a possible anyway (a little), I crunched the well
known Rubiks cube down to a flat (jigsaw) puzzle and turned it into an Android
app. I hope you like this game.

You can download the app on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hermanbergwerf.cruzzle).
