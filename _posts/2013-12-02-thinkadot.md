I build my first Android game and I wanted to build something special. I found
a game I had never heard of before and built it into an app.

The game I found is called [Think-a-Dot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think-a-Dot).
It is a puzzle game with 127 levels where you are challenged to match the small
pattern by dropping marbles in the right entries which will change the colors in
the large pattern. Each hole in the large pattern contains a switch which is
changed when a marble passes. This causes the marble to take a different route
the next time (enable the *Look inside* option to reveal this mechanism).

You can download the app on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hermanbergwerf.thinkadot).
