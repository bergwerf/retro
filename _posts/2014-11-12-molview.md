I wanted to draw molecules online but I couln't find a suitable application for
this. So I decided to create one myself and MolView was born.

In this project, I've combined some JavaScript libraries and web-services to
create an awesome and educative web application. Using this application, you can
sketch, view and search molecules online. Molecules that you draw in the
structural formula editor are resolved to 3D molecules using the NCI Chemical
Identifier Resolver. The viewer contains several 3D molecule rendering engines
including GLmol, Jmol and ChemDoodle Web. Thanks to Jmol, you can also calculate
the MEP surface of a molecule which looks pretty cool. The autocomplete input is
perhaps the coolest feature so far, you can just type something and MolView will
generate suggestions based on three databases; PubChem, RCSB and the
Crystallography Open Database.
